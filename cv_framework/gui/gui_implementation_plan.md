# GUI Implementation Plan for Computer Vision Toolkit

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to creating a modern, user-friendly GUI for the Computer Vision Toolkit. The interface will allow users to load various computer vision models and run them on webcam feeds with real-time visualization.

## Technology Selection
Based on the evaluation in `frontend_options.md` and our current requirements, we'll use **PyQt5/PySide6** for the following reasons:
- Native performance for real-time video processing
- Rich UI components for modern interfaces
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Excellent integration with OpenCV, PyTorch, and other CV libraries
- Support for multi-threading to keep the UI responsive

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture and Basic UI (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Set up Qt project structure
- [ ] Design the main application window
- [ ] Implement model loading system
- [ ] Create basic webcam integration
- [ ] Develop threading architecture for non-blocking UI

### Phase 2: Model Integration (1 week)
- [ ] Create model management system
- [ ] Implement FasterRCNN integration (port from existing code)
- [ ] Add YOLOv8 integration
- [ ] Add support for other models in the framework
- [ ] Implement model switching without application restart

### Phase 3: UI Refinement and Features (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Design and implement modern controls
  - [ ] Model selection dropdown/panel
  - [ ] Parameter adjustment sliders
  - [ ] Visualization options
- [ ] Add dark/light theme support
- [ ] Create responsive layouts for different window sizes
- [ ] Implement camera selection and resolution options
- [ ] Add recording capabilities

### Phase 4: Advanced Features and Polish (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Add benchmarking interface
- [ ] Implement model comparison view
- [ ] Create visualization options for different types of model outputs
- [ ] Add export functionality for results
- [ ] Implement configuration saving/loading
- [ ] Package for distribution

## Detailed Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Main Application Window
- Central widget for video display
- Dockable panels for controls
- Status bar for performance metrics
- Menu bar for advanced options

#### 2. Camera Handler
- Thread-safe camera access
- Support for multiple cameras
- Frame buffering for smooth display
- Resolution and FPS control

#### 3. Model Manager
- Dynamic loading/unloading of models
- Configuration management for each model
- Unified prediction interface
- Model-specific parameter controls

#### 4. Visualization System
- Customizable overlay rendering
- Support for different types of visualizations:
  - Bounding boxes
  - Segmentation masks
  - Keypoints
  - Heat maps
- Performance metrics display

## Implementation Starting Point

We'll begin with the following components:

1. **MainWindow Class**: The application's main window and controller
2. **CameraThread Class**: For handling webcam I/O in a separate thread
3. **ModelManager Class**: For loading and managing different models
4. **VisualizationWidget Class**: For displaying camera feed with overlays

## First Steps

1. Create the basic application structure
2. Implement the camera thread for displaying webcam feed
3. Port existing FasterRCNN code to the new architecture
4. Create a basic UI with model selection and parameter adjustment
5. Test the complete pipeline with FasterRCNN model

## Tools and Libraries

- **PySide6/PyQt5**: UI framework
- **OpenCV**: Camera handling and image processing
- **PyTorch**: Model inference
- **NumPy**: Data handling
- **QDarkStyle**: Modern styling (optional)
